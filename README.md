ci-test
=======

I had to compile git 1.9.0 from scratch (RHEL 6.3 does not include a git version that sign's commits).  
I don't like grabbing files from random repos...just because I believe in security.

I've never used maven and the instructions were a little cryptic towards the end.

I use git a lot for basic work.  
I use two factor authetication for my git account and I have a couple private repos on github.  


There are three branches
* master
* new-feature
* extra-credit


NOTE:  master was updated in order to digitally tag it.  This might have messed up what you are looking for in master.  Previously src didn't have any files  outside of the orginal mvn site files.  You can see what happened in my logs.


I look your sentence 'use the latest' literally.  However, I rarely like to use the latest software UNLESS there is a feature I need or want.  This philosophy saved my many servers from the Heartbeat vulnerability.

I used
* maven 3.2.1
* java 8u5

I've already submitted my work but
